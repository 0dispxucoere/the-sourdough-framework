If there is the one food from Germany it is probably bread. There are thousands
of different varieties of bread in Germany. Making bread has been an integral part
of our culture. Beginning my studies in GÃ¶ttingen for the first time I was faced
with buying bread on my own. In Germany that is no easy task
as the varieties of bread are endless. I started to check the packaging
of different bread types and noticed how there were surprisingly
many ingredients in most of the breads found in a common supermarket.
